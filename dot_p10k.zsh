# Powerlevel10k will call instant_prompt_* at the same time as the regular prompt_* function
    # and will record all `p10k segment` calls it makes. When displaying instant prompt, Powerlevel10k
    # will replay these calls without actually calling instant_prompt_*. It is imperative that
    # instant_prompt_* always makes the same `p10k segment` calls regardless of environment. If this
    # rule is not observed, the content of instant prompt will be incorrect.
    #
    # Usually, you should either not define instant_prompt_* or simply call prompt_* from it. If
    # instant_prompt_* is not defined for a segment, the segment won't be shown in instant prompt.
    function instant_prompt_example() {
        # Since prompt_example always makes the same `p10k segment` calls, we can call it from
        # instant_prompt_example. This will give us the same `example` prompt segment in the instant
        # and regular prompts.
